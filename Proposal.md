## Background/Necessity

The Seoul Public Bike (따릉이) project has witnessed a substantial increase in annual deficits, escalating from 2.5 billion won in 2016 to 10.3 billion won in 2021, as reported by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. This trend is not unique to Seoul, as several local governments across the country have faced deficits, leading to the suspension of their public bicycle programs.

## Purpose of the Analysis

The primary goal of this proposal is to address the financial challenges faced by the Seoul Public Bike project and devise strategies for deficit reduction.

## Specific Plan for Data Acquisition

Data will be sourced from [서울열린데이터광장](https://data.seoul.go.kr/dataList/datasetList.do), offering a comprehensive dataset related to public bicycles in Seoul. This dataset encompasses usage statistics, subscriber details, real-time rental information, station-specific usage data (daily and monthly), rental history, station information, and master information. Leveraging this diverse dataset will provide valuable insights into bicycle usage patterns, station-specific trends, and the integration of public bicycles with other transportation modes.

## Formulation

The analysis will employ the following techniques:

- **Linear Regression:** Identifying linear relationships within data for prediction-related tasks.
- **Random Forest:** Useful for both classification and regression tasks, enhancing model accuracy.
- **XGBoost:** Effective in handling missing data and optimizing models, providing high performance and speed.

## Expected Results and Impact

The anticipated outcomes include:

- **Increase in User Numbers:** Implementing strategies to attract more users to the public bicycle system.
- **Bicycle Redistribution:** Optimizing station-specific trends to ensure efficient distribution of bicycles.
- **Deficit Reduction:** Implementing measures to significantly reduce the current financial deficits associated with the public bicycle project.
